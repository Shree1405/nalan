Build a full-stack web application called “AI Smart Patient Triage System” for a healthcare hackathon prototype.

The application must use AI to classify patient risk levels and recommend medical departments based on symptoms and medical history.

🔹 Core Features
1️⃣ Patient Input Module

Create a clean modern medical-themed UI that collects:

Age (number input)

Gender (dropdown)

Symptoms (multi-select dropdown)

Blood Pressure (Systolic / Diastolic)

Heart Rate

Temperature

Pre-existing Conditions (multi-select)

Upload EHR/EMR file (PDF or CSV)

When file is uploaded:

Extract relevant text

Parse patient vitals and symptoms

Auto-fill the form if possible

2️⃣ AI Risk Classification Engine

Backend must:

Use XGBoost model

Accept structured patient input

Output:

Risk Level (Low / Medium / High)

Probability Score

Support 3-class classification

Handle 25,000 synthetic training records

Include:

Data preprocessing

One-hot encoding

Missing value handling

Train/test split

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

3️⃣ Department Recommendation Engine (Hybrid Logic)

If Risk = High → Emergency
If chest pain → Cardiology
If neurological symptoms → Neurology
If breathing issue → Pulmonology
Else → General Medicine

Make mapping configurable.

4️⃣ Explainability Layer

Integrate SHAP.

Display:

Top contributing factors

Feature importance chart

Confidence %

Human-readable explanation summary

Example:
“High risk due to elevated BP and chest pain.”

5️⃣ Dashboard

Create professional medical dashboard with:

Risk Level Card (color coded)

Confidence score

Recommended Department

SHAP visualization

Risk distribution chart

Model performance metrics

Patient history table

Use:

React frontend

Tailwind CSS

FastAPI backend

Chart.js or Recharts

6️⃣ Emergency Button

Add persistent red “🚨 Emergency” button on all pages.

If clicked:

Immediately assign Emergency department

Override risk classification

Log event

🔹 Synthetic Data Generation

Generate 25,000 realistic synthetic patient records including:

Correlated vitals

Logical symptom-risk relationships

Balanced class distribution

Document:

Schema

Risk assignment logic

Data generation strategy

🔹 Architecture Requirements

Generate:

System architecture diagram

Data flow diagram

ML pipeline diagram

Folder structure

🔹 Output API Format

Return prediction as:

{
"risk_level": "High",
"confidence_score": 0.87,
"recommended_department": "Cardiology",
"explanation": [
"High systolic blood pressure",
"Chest pain symptom",
"History of hypertension"
]
}

🔹 Technical Stack

Frontend:
React + Tailwind

Backend:
FastAPI

ML:
XGBoost + SHAP + Scikit-learn

Database:
PostgreSQL or MongoDB

🔹 Additional Requirements

Clean modular code

Scalable architecture

Hackathon-ready

Production-style folder structure

Proper README documentation

5-minute demo explanation script

Act as a senior AI architect and generate production-ready, well-commented, scalable code.
